For Windows use Git Bash as terminal
This allows you to work offline rather than in Git Hub
Basic commands:
1. help (shows help)
2. clear (clear everything from the terminal)
3. cd (change directory)
4. pwd (print or present working directroy)
5. ls (list)
6. cd .. (moves up 1 directory)
7. ls -all (gives more info on all files)
