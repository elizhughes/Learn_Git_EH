To turn a directory on your computer into a git repository on Git Hub.
Use git init
cd to the directory you want to make into a repo
Go to yuor file manager and drag the file into the terminal
NB: remove c: from the path
type 'git init' 
 you will get   " Initialised emmpty git repository in/ <path>
Type 'git status'
  you will get:  "untracked files:
                (use "git add <filename>" to include in what will be commited)
                Then a list of file
                Then: "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
'git add <filename>'
'git commit -m "add comment on what doing"
NB to add all files in directory type: 'git add .'
'git status' to check
'git commit -m "comment"
Now you need to put thefiles onto GitHub.
Currently they are in a staging area waiting to be added.
'git remote -v' shows the repo on git hub
If you strat a repo on yout computer it does not have a GitHub remote associated with it so you need to add that remote in.
Go to GitHub and make an emprty repo.
NB do not check the 'initialize with a read me file' at this stage.
This will make an empty repo with no files
It tells you what to do:
git init
git add
git commit
You have already done these.
Next there is a bit about the main branch......
 in Git Bash 'git remote add origin url'
 'git remote -v' to check all is good
 'git push origin main'  to push files to the main branch in origin on GitHub
 Oncefiles are in the repo in GitHub you can make changes there.
 Then on Git Bash type 'git fetch' to check if anything is outstanding onyour local copy.
 Then 'git pull orgin main' to pull chnages into your local copy.
